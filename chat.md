AI interaction overview: used Deep seek

Prompting Details:

Prompt 1: We asked it to help improve the layout of our website, adding animated objects on our website page, and generate a quiz for our website.

We used AI to help walk us through technical error we were facing
Prompt 2:"how do I code it in vs studio and see live results", the AI gave us a set of steps to follow which helped us see our live results including the method and a way to do a quick test. 

We also asked the AI for assistance in creating a smooth scrolling feature. 
Prompt 3:

Project Evolution:

It helped us fix minor mistakes and helps us with aligning our overall website to look more refined. It helped give us something to start from when it came to our color palette, we used the colors given as a base from which we found other colors that suited our aesthetic best and then found the relevant hexadecimals and RGB’s. We were able to build off a smooth scrolling feature with the help of AI and implement it in our JavaScript file.

——Project Evolution——
Color Palette Development
The AI provided an initial pastel color scheme that served as our foundation. We then expanded on these suggestions by exploring complementary shades that better suited our brand aesthetic. Through iterative refinement, we sourced the precise hexadecimal values for our final color palette, creating a cohesive visual identity that maintains femininity while ensuring accessibility.

Technical Refinement
AI assistance helped us identify and correct minor coding errors while providing valuable suggestions for overall layout optimization. The smooth scrolling functionality, initially implemented with AI guidance, became a springboard for further enhancements as we customized the scrolling behavior and integrated it with other interactive elements. This iterative process resulted in a more polished and professional final product.

Feature Enhancement
Starting from basic AI suggestions, we evolved each feature through multiple iterations. The quiz functionality grew from a simple Q&A to include progress tracking, result matching, and community integration. The animated elements were refined to be more subtle and performance-optimized. Each component underwent continuous improvement based on both AI recommendations and our own design sensibilities.
